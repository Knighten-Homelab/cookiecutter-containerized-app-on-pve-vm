# Homelab - Cookiecutter Template For Containizered App Deployed On A PVE VM

This repo is used with [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) to create templated projects for deploying containerized applications on a Proxmox Virtual Environment (PVE) VM. It is designed to bootstrap a new project that contained all the core componenets to be used with my homelab's devops processes.
